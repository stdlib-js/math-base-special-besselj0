    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

> Compute the [Bessel function of the first kind][bessel-first-kind] of order zero.

<section class="intro">

The [Bessel function of the first kind][bessel-first-kind] of order zero is defined as

<!-- <equation class="equation" label="eq:bessel_first_kind_order_zero" align="center" raw="J_0 (x) = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\pi}^\pi e^{- i x \sin(\tau)} \,d\tau." alt="Bessel function of the first kind of order zero"> -->

```math
J_0 (x) = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\pi}^\pi e^{- i x \sin(\tau)} \,d\tau.
```

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
import j0 from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/math-base-special-besselj0@deno/mod.js';
```

#### j0( x )

Computes the [Bessel function of the first kind][bessel-first-kind] of order zero at `x`.

```javascript
var v = j0( 0.0 );
// returns 1.0

v = j0( 1.0 );
// returns ~0.765

v = j0( Infinity );
// returns 0.0

v = j0( -Infinity );
// returns 0.0

v = j0( NaN );
// returns NaN
```

<section class="examples">

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
import randu from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/random-base-randu@deno/mod.js';
import j0 from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/math-base-special-besselj0@deno/mod.js';

var x;
var i;

for ( i = 0; i < 100; i++ ) {
    x = randu() * 10.0;
    console.log( 'j0(%d) = %d', x, j0( x ) );
}
